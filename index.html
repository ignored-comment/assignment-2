          <h3><i>Movie Review of "The Founder"</i></h3>
            <p>Every single day, McDonald's serves 1% of the populution.</p>
            <p>"The Founder" is the story of the McDonald's brothers,
              America, and the man that took a small restaurant in San Bernadino, 
              California and catapulted it into the international stage,
              turning what was once a small burger shack into an American icon. 
              This story, however, is not all peaches and cream. 
              Though success by Ray Kroc and the McDonald's corporation was had, 
              viewers are able to watch the inside story of a man
              persistent and tenacious - a man willing to destroy the 
              relationships with all others in exchange for achievement.
              This is the story of Ray Kroc.

          <h3><i>Excerpts from Carol Dweck's 'Mindset'</i></h3>
            <p>Every day new information is becoming available as consumable data. 
              People, organizations, and algorithms are continuing to generate 
              information to be uploaded and accessed through the internet. 
              I have looked up the total storage data of the internet: 
              some sources from 2014 estimate 1 million exabytes. I cannot 
              even begin to fathom this number.  </p>
            <p>Knowing that I will realistically never be able to see even a fraction
              of that data, I believe it is essential to maintain a growth-mindset 
              in my life, personally and professionally. Personally, it means that 
              there is no longer an excuse for wanting to learn a new skill and not
              knowing where to start. With YouTube, I can search a topic and find 
              an expertâ€™s opinion on the subject. I can also Google communities 
              that are also have an interest in the same skill I am trying to learn. 
              Professionally, this means that my skill and depth of knowledge 
              stagnates at a much fast rate than it might have 20 or 30 years ago. </p>
